<p>The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This
way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering,
and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal
languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they
design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs
among alternatives.  Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex
systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
<p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <strong>problem
solving</strong>. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As
it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
practice problem solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, <em>The Way of
the Program</em>.</p>
<p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On
another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along,
that end will become clearer.</p>

<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<p>If problem solving is a central part of computer science, then the solutions that you create through
the problem solving process are also important.  In computer science, we refer to these solutions
as <strong>algorithms</strong>.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.</p>
<p>Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general solution.  Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate the execution.  As noted
above, programming is a skill which allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in
a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer.  These programs are written in <strong>programming languages</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-python-programming-language">
<h1>The Python Programming Language</h1>
<p>The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example
of a <strong>high-level language</strong>; other high-level languages you might have heard
of are C++, PHP, and Java.</p>
<p>As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also
<strong>low-level languages</strong>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly
languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in
low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be
processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is
a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.</p>
<p>First, it is much easier to program in a
high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time
to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be
correct. Second, high-level languages are <strong>portable</strong>, meaning that they can
run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level
programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run
on another.</p>
<p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
applications.</p>
<p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
<strong>interpreters</strong> and <strong>compilers</strong>. An interpreter reads a high-level program
and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the
program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing
computations.</p>
<img alt="Interpret illustration" src="Figures/interpret.png" />
<p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program
starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the <strong>source
code</strong>, and the translated program is called the <strong>object code</strong> or the
<strong>executable</strong>. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly
without further translation.</p>
<img alt="Compile illustration" src="Figures/compile.png" />
<p>Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower
level language, called <strong>byte code</strong>, and then interpreted by a program called
a <strong>virtual machine</strong>. Python uses both processes, but because of the way
programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use the Python interpreter: <em>shell mode</em> and <em>program
mode</em>. In shell mode, you type Python expressions into the <strong>Python shell</strong>,
and the interpreter immediately shows the result.  The example below shows the Python shell at work.</p>

<span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> is called the <strong>Python prompt</strong>. The interpreter uses the prompt to
indicate that it is ready for instructions. We typed <tt class="docutils literal">2 + 3</tt>, and the
interpreter evaluated our expression, and replied <tt class="docutils literal">5</tt>, and on the next line
it gave a new prompt, indicating that it is ready for more input.</p>
<p>Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of
code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to
help you work out problems. Anything longer than a few lines should be put into
a script.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can write an entire program in a file and use the interpreter to
execute the contents of the file as a whole. Such a file is often referred to as <strong>source code</strong>.  For
example, we used a text editor to create a source code file named <tt class="docutils literal">firstprogram.py</tt> with
the following contents:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with
<tt class="docutils literal">.py</tt> .  Following this convention will help your operating system and other
programs identify a file as containing python code.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">firstprogram</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>

<p>This book provides two additional ways to execute Python programs.  Both techniques are designed to assist you as you
learn the Python programming language.  They will help you increase your understanding of how Python programs work.</p>
<p>First, you can write, modify, and execute programs using a unique <strong>activecode</strong> interpreter that allows you to execute Python code right
in the text itself (right from the web browser).  Although this is certainly not the way real programs are written, it provides an excellent
environment for learning a programming language like Python since you can experiment with the language as you are reading.</p>
<p>Take a look at the activecode interpreter in action.  If we use the Python code from the previous example and make it active, you will see that it can be executed directly by pressing the <em>run</em> button.   Try pressing the <em>run</em> button below.</p>

<p>Now try modifying the activecode program shown above.  First, modify the string in the first print statement
by changing the word <em>adds</em> to the word <em>multiplies</em>.  Now press <em>run</em>.  You can see that the result of the program
has changed.  However, it still prints &quot;5&quot; as the answer.  Modify the second print statement by changing the
addition symbol, the &quot;+&quot;, to the multiplication symbol, &quot;*&quot;.  Press <em>run</em> to see the new results.</p>
<p>You can also make changes and save them for reloading later. <em>Save</em> and <em>Load</em> allow you to keep one copy of the program you are working on.  For example, press the <em>Save</em> button now.  You have just saved the current contents of the activecode window.  Now make a few changes and press the <em>Run</em> button.  You have changed the current program.
Press <em>Load</em> to return your program to its previously saved state.</p>
<p>In addition to activecode, you can also execute Python code with the assistance of a unique visualization tool.  This tool, known as <strong>codelens</strong>, allows you to control the step by step execution of a program.  It also lets you see the values of
all variables as they are created and modified.  The following example shows codelens in action on the same program as we saw above.  Note that in activecode, the source code executes from beginning to end and you can see the final result.  In codelens you can see and control the step by step progress.</p>
<p>The examples in this book use a mixture of the standard Python  interpreter, source code, activecode, and codelens.  You
will be able to tell which is which by looking for either the Python prompt in the case of a shell mode program, the <em>run</em> button for the activecode, or the <em>forward/backward</em> buttons for codelens.</p>

<h1>More About Programs</h1>
<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a
computation. The computation might be something as complex as rendering an html page in a web browser
or encoding a video and streaming it across the network.  It can also be a
symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing text in a document or
(strangely enough) compiling a program.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions
appear in just about every language.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</dd>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd>Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</dd>
<dt>math and logic</dt>
<dd>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, and multiplication,
and logical operations like <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">not</tt>.</dd>
<dt>conditional execution</dt>
<dd>Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of
statements.</dd>
<dt>repetition</dt>
<dd>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've
ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more
or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of
breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the
subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic
instructions.</p>

<h1>What is Debugging?</h1>
<p>Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings, it
often leads to errors. Programming errors are called <strong>bugs</strong> and the process
of tracking them down and correcting them is called <strong>debugging</strong>.  Some claim
that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one
of the first computers at Harvard, and the term <strong>bug</strong> has remained in use
since. For more about this historic event, see <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg">first bug</a>.</p>
<p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</a>.  It is useful to distinguish
between them in order to track them down more quickly.</p>

<h1>Syntax errors</h1>
<p>Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct;
otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.  <strong>Syntax</strong> refers
to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example,
in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
this sentence contains a <strong>syntax error</strong>. So does this one</p>
<p>For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is
why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems.
Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your
program, Python will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able
to run your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you
will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain
experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.</p>

   :feedback_a: A syntax error is an error in the structure of the python code that can be detected before the program is executed.   Python cannot usually tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value—you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program).
   :feedback_b: This is a problem with the formal structure of the program.  Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it.
   :feedback_c: This will produce the wrong answer, but Python will not consider it an error at all.  The programmer is the one who understands that the answer produced is wrong.

   :feedback_c:  Okay, sort of.  But it is a special thing in the computer that does it.  The stand alone computer without this additional piece can not do it.
   :feedback_d: Maybe.  Your teacher and instructor may be able to find most of your syntax errors, but only because they have experience looking at code and possibly writing code.  With experience syntax errors are easier to find.  But we also have an automated way of finding these types of errors.

<h1>Experimental Debugging</h1>
<p>One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging.  Although it
can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich,
challenging, and interesting parts of programming.</p>
<p>In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues,
and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.</p>
<p>Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea what is
going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was
correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a
step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to
come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, When you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth. (A. Conan Doyle, <em>The Sign of Four</em>)</p>
<p>For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is,
programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what
you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does
<em>something</em> and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you
always have a working program.</p>
<p>For example, Linux is an operating system kernel that contains millions of
lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to
explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, one of Linus's
earlier projects was a program that would switch between displaying AAAA and
BBBB. This later evolved to Linux (<em>The Linux Users' Guide</em> Beta Version 1).</p>
<p>Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming
practices.</p>

<h1>Formal and Natural Languages</h1>
<p><strong>Natural languages</strong> are the languages that people speak, such as English,
Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to
impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Formal languages</strong> are languages that are designed by people for specific
applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal
language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and
symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of
molecules. And most importantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to
express computations.</em></blockquote>
<p>Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, <tt class="docutils literal">3+3=6</tt>
is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3=+6$</span></tt> is not.
H<sub>2</sub>O is a syntactically correct chemical name, but <sub>2</sub>Zz is
not.</p>
<p>Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to <strong>tokens</strong> and structure.
Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and
chemical elements. One of the problems with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3=+6$</span></tt> is that <tt class="docutils literal">$</tt> is not a
legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly,
<sub>2</sub>Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation
<tt class="docutils literal">Zz</tt>.</p>
<p>The second type of syntax rule pertains to the <strong>structure</strong> of a statement---
that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3=+6$</span></tt> is
structurally illegal because you can't place a plus sign immediately after an
equal sign.  Similarly, molecular formulas have to have subscripts after the
element name, not before.</p>
<p>When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you
have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural
language you do this subconsciously). This process is called <strong>parsing</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, when you hear the sentence, &quot;The other shoe fell&quot;, you understand
that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb.  Once you have parsed
a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the <strong>semantics</strong> of the sentence.
Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will
understand the general implication of this sentence.</p>
<p>Although formal and natural languages have many features in common --- tokens,
structure, syntax, and semantics --- there are many differences:</p>

    ambiguity
        Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by
        using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are
        designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any
        statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.

    redundancy
        In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural
        languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often
        verbose.  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.

    literalness
        Formal languages mean exactly what they say.  On the other hand,
        natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, &quot;The
        other shoe fell&quot;, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling.

        .. tip::

            You'll need to find the original joke to understand the idiomatic
            meaning of the other shoe falling.  *Yahoo! Answers* thinks it
            knows!

<p>People who grow up speaking a natural language---everyone---often have a hard
time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal
and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more
so:</p>

    poetry
        Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the
        whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity
        is not only common but often deliberate.

    prose
        The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure
        contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than
        poetry but still often ambiguous.

    program
        The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can
        be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

</pre>
</div>
<p>Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages).
First, remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural
languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very
important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to
right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens
and interpreting the structure.  Finally, the details matter. Little things
like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away with in
natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.</p>

   :answer_a: Natural languages can be parsed while formal languages cannot.
   :answer_b: Ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness
   :answer_c: There are no differences between natural and formal languages.
   :answer_d: Tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Actually both languages can be parsed (determining the structure of the sentence), but formal languages can be parsed more easily in software.
   :feedback_b: All of these can be present in natural languages but cannot exist in formal languages.
   :feedback_c: There are several differences between the two but they are also similar.
   :feedback_d: These are the similarities between the two.

   The differences between natural and formal languages include:

   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: It usually takes longer to read a program because the structure is as important as the content and must be interpreted in smaller pieces for understanding.
   :feedback_b: It usually takes longer to read a program because the structure is as important as the content and must be interpreted in smaller pieces for understanding.

   True or False:  Reading a program is like reading other kinds of text.

<h1>A Typical First Program</h1>
<p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called <em>Hello,
World!</em> because all it does is display the words, Hello, World!  In Python, the source code
looks like this.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This is an example of using the <strong>print function</strong>, which doesn't actually
print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the
result is the words:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">Hello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="err">!</span>

the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Python does about as well as
possible.</p>

<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read.
Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of
code and figure out what it is doing, or why.
For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in
natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called comments.</p>
<p>A <strong>comment</strong> in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human
reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter.
In Python, the <cite>#</cite> token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored.

<p>Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the phrase Hello, World!  None of the comments appear.
You'll also notice that we've left a blank line in the program.  Blank lines
are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your
programs much easier for humans to parse.  Use them liberally!</p>

.. glossary::

    activecode
        A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed from within a web browser.

    algorithm
        A general step by step process for solving a problem.

    bug
        An error in a program.

    byte code
        An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many
        modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then
        interpret the byte code with a program called a *virtual machine*.

    codelens
        An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step by step execution of a Python program

    comment
        Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone
        reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the
        program.

    compile
        To translate a program written in a high-level language into a
        low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

    debugging
        The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of
        programming errors.

    exception
        Another name for a runtime error.

    executable
        Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

    formal language
        Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific
        purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs;
        all programming languages are formal languages.

    high-level language
        A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for
        humans to read and write.

    interpret
        To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one
        line at a time.

    low-level language
        A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to
        execute; also called machine language or assembly language.

    natural language
        Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

    object code
        The output of the compiler after it translates the program.

    parse
        To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

    portability
        A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

    print function
        A function used in a program or script that causes the Python
        interpreter to display a value on its output device.

    problem solving
        The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and
        expressing the solution.

    program
        A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and
        computations to be performed.

    programming language
                A formal notation for representing solutions.

    Python shell
        An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a
        Python shell types commands at the prompt (&gt;&gt;&gt;), and presses the return
        key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for
        processing.

    runtime error
        An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute
        but that prevents the program from continuing.



    semantic error
        An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
        programmer intended.

    semantics
        The meaning of a program.

    shell mode
        A style of using Python where we type expressions at the command
        prompt, and the results are shown immediately.  Contrast with
        **source code**, and see the entry under **Python shell**.

    source code
        A program, stored in a file, in a high-level language before being compiled or interpreted.

    syntax
        The structure of a program.

    syntax error
        An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse --- and
        therefore impossible to interpret.

    token
        One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program,
        analogous to a word in a natural language.
