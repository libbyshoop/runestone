Recursive Functions Activity
============================

**COMP 123**

Examples
--------

Form into groups of two or three students each. Look
at the functions in the file
:download:`recexamples.py <recexamples.py>`. Pick **ONE** of
Examples 1, 2, and 3 to work on. Read the function carefully, then
look at the starred sample call (\*\*\*\*). Work through what would
happen with that call, drawing a diagram that shows a trace of the
recursion. Your diagram can be a "happy robots" diagram, OR the
more simplified form shown in the file for the example `fact`
function.



If you quickly finish your example, look at another; the `fib`
function at the bottom of the file is a challenge question.
