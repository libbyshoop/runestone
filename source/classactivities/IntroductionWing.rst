Some quick things about Wing

#. Wing maps the ctrl-= key for pc and cmd-= key for macs to indent
   to match by default for Python or you can get the indentation from the source menu.

4. Python Shell -- This Python command prompt lets you try out code
   in a sandbox process kept isolated from Wing IDE and your debug
   process. The python shell is on the right side with a >>>.
5. Basic Debugging -- Set a breakpoint and start debugging. The bug
   icon helps you debug your codes.You can debug
   your code by clicking on the bug icon. For more information about
   debugging, you can access the Debugging with Wing text. You should
   save the files you create for later use.

6. Conditional breakpoints -- A powerful tool in isolating complex
   bugs by stopping before they occur.
