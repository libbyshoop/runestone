A.R. Drone Activity
===================

**COMP 123**

In this activity, you will be required to write a program in Wing to carry out certain movements in ardrone. Each team will be asked to write a program that should fly the drone in the atrium.

In order to control the movements, you should use the functions provided in  `libardrone'. You are required to read the documentation to know about how drone works. It will also guide you through setting up the drone for a flight.

Be creative but keep in mind that the space provided for flying the ardrone is limited. The program should be able to fly the drone without any collisions against the walls and the flight shouldn't be too high.
